# SageMaker Deployment Project

Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model on Amazon Sagemaker which consists of deploying a Sentiment Analysis model using Recurrent Neural Networks in the Amazon AWS SageMaker tool. The notebook and Python files provided here result in a simple web application which interacts with a deployed recurrent neural network performing sentiment analysis on movie reviews. In the final architecture AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions is used as well.

The original code without solutions can be found in the original [Udacity SageMaker Deployment repository](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment).

This project assumes some familiarity with SageMaker, the IMDB Sentiment Analysis using XGBoost mini-project (which can be found in the original repository) should provide enough background.

## Setup instructions
Please see the [original README](https://github.com/udacity/sagemaker-deployment/tree/master/README.md) in the root directory for instructions on setting up a SageMaker notebook and downloading the project files (as well as the other notebooks). For the solutions only clone this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:prateeksawhney97/Deploying-a-Sentiment-Analysis-Model-on-Amazon-Sagemaker.git
exit
```
